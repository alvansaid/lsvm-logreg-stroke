# Linear Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression for Stroke Dataset
This is my first machine learning project. 

* The purposed is to help classify cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke based on brain CT scan description. Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression are examples of linear classifier in machine learning methods. 

* In this study, linear SVM and logistic regression was applied for classifying cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke data (unpublished data). The models got accuracy more than 90% which are good for balance classification task.

* Not a good one project because there's still a wrong flow in it, but still this give me experience to stay eager to learn.
